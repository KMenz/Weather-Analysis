# Weather-Analysis

This is an analysis of Weather Data for a randomly generated sample of cities across the globe. The cities were chosen using citipy and the data for each city was pulled from the OpenWeatherMap API

We compared the latitude of each city to the temperature, cloudiness, humidity, and wind speed. Then created figures for each relationship using MatPlotLib for Scatter Plots and then posted analysis at the top.
